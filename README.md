# Voices of the Manhattan Project: Exploring the Cultural Memory of AHF Oral Histories about the Manhattan Project.

## Abstract
Our project is an attempt to use computational tools to explore the memories contained in the [Voices of the Manhattan Project](https://ahf.nuclearmuseum.org/voices/), an archive containing more than 600 oral histories of people living during the Manhattan Project. We applied Topic modelling and Name-Entity Extraction Recognition (NER) to extract the salient topics and people that are remembered in this corpus. Furthermore, we connect our results to previous works in the field of memory studies to put them in the context of possible psychological and social constraints that affect the act of remembering itself. Alongside our results, we also engage in a discussion regarding potential future investigations that could stem from this project as a foundation.
